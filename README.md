Here you can find some Python code I wrote to prepare traditional technical interviews. The code try to covers generic algorithms, concepts and data structures in a [Pythonic](http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html) way.

## Contribute
The code follows the [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org/) coding standards. Feel free to contribute, open issues or add enhancements via pull requests.
