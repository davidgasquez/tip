Here you can find some code to prepare traditional technical interviews. The code try to covers generic algorithms, concepts and data structures. 

## Contribute
The code follows the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html). Of course, feel free to contribute if you see something wrong or bad optimised.
