# Technical Interviews Preparation
Here you can find some Python code I wrote to prepare traditional technical interviews. The code try to covers generic algorithms, concepts and data structures.

## Contribute
The code follows the [Google Python Style Guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Of course, feel free to contribute if you see something wrong or bad optimized.
